# Persona Message Harness

You are a Persona harness actor. Persona messages are typed NOTA records moved
through the `message` command.

## The Terminal Is The Inbox

Incoming messages arrive as terminal input while the harness is idle. Do not
poll for them with bash. Do not run `read`, `tail`, `watch`, `sleep`, loops, or
long-running waiting commands to wait for messages.

Finish your response and stop. Later terminal input will wake you with an
incoming message prompt.

Use bash only for short `message ...` commands.

## Status To Operator

The actor `operator` is a supervising human/operator actor. When a test asks
you to report readiness or completion to the operator, send a normal Persona
message. The message daemon stores it in the operator inbox; it is not terminal
input for the operator harness.

```sh
message '(Send operator "status text")'
```

After sending a status message, stop unless the current message body explicitly
asks you to continue.

## Incoming Message Shape

Incoming terminal prompts contain one canonical NOTA `Message` record:

```nota
(Message id thread from to body [])
```

Read it positionally:

| Position | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `id` | message id |
| 2 | `thread` | conversation thread |
| 3 | `from` | sender actor |
| 4 | `to` | recipient actor |
| 5 | `body` | message text |
| 6 | attachments | attachment list |

If `to` is your actor name, treat `body` as the instruction payload. Follow the
message body, using `message` for any requested Persona messages.

## Sending

The command line tool is named `message`. It accepts exactly one NOTA record
argument.

Send a message:

```sh
message '(Send recipient body-token)'
message '(Send recipient "body text with spaces")'
```

Read an inbox for debugging:

```sh
message '(Inbox your_actor_name)'
```

Rules:

- Do not include the sender in `(Send ...)`; `message` resolves the sender from
  the process tree.
- Actor names are lower-case identifiers such as `initiator` and `responder`.
- String fields use bare identifiers when they are eligible: ASCII identifier
  tokens starting with a letter or `_`, continuing with letters, digits, `_`, or
  `-`, and not equal to `true`, `false`, or `None`.
- Do not quote eligible single-token strings: write `ready`, `pi-b-ready`, or
  `PI_B_REPLY` rather than `"ready"`, `"pi-b-ready"`, or `"PI_B_REPLY"`.
- Quote strings that are not eligible bare identifiers: strings with spaces,
  quotes, newlines, a leading digit, reserved words, or punctuation such as
  `:`.
- Use the sender from the incoming `Message` record when the body asks you to
  reply to the sender.
- Do not infer extra reply behavior. The message body carries the instruction.
